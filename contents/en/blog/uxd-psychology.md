The result of the work can be even more positive if a designer uses psychology in the creative process, as science conveys the exact understanding of the target audience. Psychological knowledge helps to create the design that allows users to perform the expected actions, e.g.For example, make a purchase or contact the team. Designers may view psychology as a complicated approach to design improvement, and for that reason neglect that part of the research and analysis.

The sense of beauty and inspiration is not enough to create a professional design. One of the basic studies that helps designers understand users is psychology. Today we will find out what role psychology plays in design and which psychological principles are to be followed during the design process.
UX is about combining data and normal human emotions, using empathy and accessibility to combine it with effective storytelling. As a design field based on human nature, it is deeply rooted in psychology. UX connects design and psychology and eventually becomes a kind of sociological account of who we are, what we believe in and what we want.

### ðŸ‘€ People ignore design that ignores people.

Invest in UX research to really understand who your audience is, what likes and dislikes it has and how it behaves. Then you can use the psychology of the user experience to create an effective digital tool for engagement. Talk to us about developing digital tools that use the psychology of the user experience.
A psychologist, like any health care professional, will always seek information about his client before giving advice. If we want to provide users with a solution to change their behavior, we first need to understand where they come from and what motivates them to change their behavior. Only through a deeper understanding of our users and the way they interact with our product can we create an interface that is usable and adds value. Customer Experience Cards, Personas, and User Travel are useful tools for gathering insights and serve as a great reference for the entire UX and design process.
This may be because you may not understand how to use different psychological principles to design your products to trigger specific responses and actions from your users. Your customers are driven by emotions when they look at a website and wonder if they should buy a product or not. They instinctively try to connect with the brand, and depending on what they see, they either complete the sale or not. Psychology plays an important role in shaping the user experience as some principles influence human behavior. 14
When choosing colors for your website and branding, you should understand your audience, purpose, and timing to maximize the efficiency of your design and create certain emotions associated with your brand. Cognitive psychology studies show that the more attractive a product is, the more useful it is. Positive feelings and attraction are associated with higher quality.In other words, if your users see what they see, your sales will increase. 19
Already in the early stages of UX research, we can see the importance of user observation through our mimicry abilities. By observing a user in person, our brains mimic their actions and can better understand the activities they are participating in. When designing the UX, we must consider the need for a social network on our website or in our application. Enable greater social connectivity of your designs so that users within your application can consult and advise each other, such as:With reviews, reviews, news and forums.

### ðŸ™„ Rule of thumb for UX: More options, more problems.

In other words, we use knowledge that we already have from previous experiences when we interact with something new. As a result, users can easily transfer their knowledge from one product or experience to another, without taking their time to understand how the new system works. The task of narrowing the gap between our mental models and those of our users is one of our greatest challenges.To do that, we use a variety of methods: user interviews, personas, travel maps, empathy maps, and more.
I was also allowed to return to my university to give a lecture to 3rd year psychology students on the importance of psychological research for user experience design. Many of the students Iâ€™ve spoken to have never heard of .So it was really worthwhile to share my experiences with them and to give you some advice on how to enter the industry with a psychological background. But with this pressure, there is an incredible sense of satisfaction as each project becomes a new challenge and a new opportunity to learn something completely new.
Emotional reactions and excitement can be detected with skin sensors or facial analysis. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that captures electrical activity in the brain. Fortunately, neuroscience can help us diagnose problems, but also highlight common solutions and best practices. Here are some general insights from researching the user experience in neuroscience that designers can use when designing digital products.


### ðŸŒˆ Every great design begins with an even better story


They need to observe a user base, understand how to use and shape their current tools. Both qualitative and quantitative data are essential for designers to develop a human insight approach to design. Quantitative data can provide information about a demographic situation, but qualitative data can provide detailed information about how the user interacts with themes (such as user testing).
