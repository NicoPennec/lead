      para=" I started thinking of Elevito back at end of September 2017 while I was still In Lucknow, pursuing
    Computer Science Engineering with some of my crazy friends who were so good in web development. Me and friend wanted
    to do something of our own, one night I got a chance to do it under the hat of one of my Senior. It was really mind bending
    for me and very challenging.
    <br />
    <br />
So here I was, crawling Pintrest, going through design agencies website, looking thirstily for some
    inspiration that could move me. After few days of this or that, I found a specific visual split in half and
    that's basically where the whole concept came from."

    <!--       When we work on something that we have to decide on our own about every aspects of a product. It gets more challenging than ever.
      Then we are in constant dilemma of this or that. Iteration seems to never stop. Its get frustrating.
      Though we are not restricted by anything, its also fun and our mind happen to work round the clock to make decisions.

        <br> <br>Making something stand out and gives a feel of creativity and wowness. 
        was cool for the moment but that can not be used to used on web.
